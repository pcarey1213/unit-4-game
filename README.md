# Crystal Collector

### Overview

A fun, interactive game for web browsers using JQuery. This app dynamically updates HTML with the JQuery library. 

### How to Play

* There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player is shown a random target number (orange box) at the start of the game.

* Each time the player clicks a crystal, a specific amount of points is added to the player's total score. 

* The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

* When they do click one, the player's score counter (green box) is updated.

* The player wins if their total score matches the target number.

* The player loses if their score goes above the target number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, a new target number is generated. Each crystals also has four new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

* The player's total wins and losses are shown (purple box)
